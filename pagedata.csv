3,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3,3,                             Time of occurence of janaba unknown.                         ," Praise be to Allah.If a man sees the signs of sexual discharge impurity (janaba)    on his clothes, and he is not sure when the discharge occurred, and he had performed    several prayers (salaat) not knowing, he has to perform major ablution (ghusl)    and repeat the salaat from the most recent sleep in which he was wearing this    clothes. However, if he finds out that the janaba was from a previous sleep,    then he should repeat salaat from the last sleep he thinks the janaba occurred1.    The references (adillah) on the religious duty of performing ghusl due to janaba    in preparation for salaat are many, one of which is Allah's command in the Qur'an,    a translated meaning of which is: ""O' You who believe, do not get approach    salaat while you are drunk until you know what you are saying, nor while impure    due to sexual discharge (junob) unless you are traveling about until you perform    ghusl"" (4:43). And Ali's narration (hadith), (may Allah be pleased with    him), in which he said ""I was a man with frequent urethral discharge, so    I kept performing ghusl until the skin of my back started cracking, so I mentioned    this to the Prophet  peace be upon him (or it was    mentioned to him) so the messenger of Allah  (peace    be upon him) said, ""Don't do ghusl if you see urethral discharge, just    wash your male organ and perform wudu' same as wudu' of salaat. If semen appears,    then perform ghusl""2.    This hadith indicates that appearance of semen requires ghusl whereas urethral    discharge only needs washing of the sexual organ followed by wudu'.From the book What Should You Do in the Following    Situtations...? 1 Al-Mughni ma'a al-Sharh il-Kabeer    1/199.   2 Narrated by Abu Dawood number 206 and verified sahih    by Albani in Arwaa' al-Ghaleel number 125.

4,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4,4,                             It is not appropriate for circumcision to be a barrier to someone entering Islam                         ," Praise be to Allah.Thank you for submitting this question, because the issue of circumcision is one of the issues which in several cases forms a barrier for some of those who want to enter the religion of Islam. The matter is easier than many people think. As for (male) circumcision, it is one of the symbols of Islam, is part of sound human nature (fitrah), and is part of the way of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth” [an-Nahl 16:123]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Ibraaheem the Prophet (peace be upon him) circumcised himself when he was eighty years old…” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6/388). Circumcision is obligatory for a Muslim man, if he is able to do it. If he is not able to do it, such as if he fears that he may die if he is circumcised, or if a trustworthy doctor has told him that it will lead to haemorrhaging that may cause his death, then he is exempt from circumcision in that case, and he is not sinning if he does not do it. But it is not appropriate under any circumstances to let the issue of circumcision be a barrier that prevents a person from entering the faith; rather the soundness of a person’s Islam does not depend upon him being circumcised. A person’s entering the religion of Islam is valid even if he does not get circumcised. With regard to the issue of female circumcision, you will find the answer in question no. 427 . I ask Allah to enable you to do all that is good and to protect you from all that is evil. Blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad.

5,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5,5,                             Does a woman who miscarries and discharges blood pray                         ," Praise be to Allah.This case depends on the type of blood. Is the blood what is known    as child-birth bleeding nifas or vaginal bleeding istihada (but not part    of her regular period)? The scholars have declared the regulation in this matter.    They said: ""If she sees the blood after the abortion of a formed human    being, then it is nifas; if she sees blood after the abortion of a clot, then    it is not nifas.""1 In    the latter case, she is considered to be mustahada so she performs wudu'    for every salaat when the time for it is due and she prays. Whereas if the aborted    object is a fetus or has human-formed organs like an arm or a leg or a head,    then it is considered nifas. For the case where the aborted object is disposed    of in the hospital before the woman saw it, the scholars have mentioned that    the least amount of time human form starts to take place is eighty one days    after pregnancy.2 This is    based on what came in Abdullah Bin Masoud's hadith (may Allah be pleased    with him), in which he said the Prophet  (peace    be upon him) spoke to us, and he is the truthful and believed one, and said:    ""Each one of you, human creation, forms in his mother's womb forty days,    then he is a hanging clot for the same amount of time, then he is a mudgha    (the size of a morsel) for the same amount of time, then Allah sends an Angel    who is commanded with four things: he is told to write his deeds, his livelihood    and sustenance, whether he is happy or distressed ""3    Ladies in this case should spend the effort to find out from the doctors' estimations    until her situation is clear to her. As for the blood that is discharged just prior to a normal delivery,    if it is accompanied with the pains of contraction then it is nifas, and if    not, then it is not. Sheikh ul-Islam Ibn Taimiyya, may the mercy of Allah    be upon him, said: ""What she sees when the contractions commence is nifas.    What is referred to here is contractions after which follows delivery; otherwise    it is not nifas.""4 From the book What Should You Do in    the Following Situations... ? 1 al-Mughni ma' al-Sharh il-Kabeer    1/3612 Majmooa Fatawi ibn    Uthaimeen 4/292 Dar al-Qutni printing.3 Sahih al-Buhari    6/303, Dar al-Fikr printing   4 Majmooa Fatawi Ibn Uthaimeen 4/327, Dar    al-Fikr printing.

So the Messenger of Allah, (peace be upon him), said: ""That is a shaitan called Khanzab,    so if you feel his presence, seek refuge in Allah and blow a mist to your left    three times."" He said: ""I applied this advice and Allah has rid me    off him.""1 This hadith    includes two ways to get rid off the shaitan of salat. The first is asking refuge    in Allah from the shaitan's evil by pronouncing the words of seeking refuge    and this is OK in this case. And the second: blowing with mist to the left three    times. This is basically blowing air in a similar manner to spitting, but with    a minute mist of saliva, on the condition that this does not disturb or bother    the person next to him, nor make the masjid dirty.
